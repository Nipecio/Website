        <h1>Chinese!</h1>
        <p>Chinese food is my top most favirote food because of how it tastes AND how it looks. It always looks like it came out of a very fancy restuarant all warm and hot. Everytime I see this, I laugh to myself when I see people eating other types of food. they could like it though. Chinese culture s also very cool when I see dragons and other mythical reaturse roaming around in the books.</p>
