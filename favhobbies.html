       <h1>Swimming</h1>
       <p>Swimming is on of my most favirote sports and hobbies because I love going in water and dong cool tricks while I am getting exercise. One time when I was small I went to the pool almost EVERY DAY of Summer and I was happy with that. One time I divied off a diving board and it was so fun jumping from so high and splashing into the water with a satisfying splash. </p>
