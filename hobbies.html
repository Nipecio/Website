        <h1>My Favorite Hobbies!</h1>

        <h2 class="rollss"><img width="30px" src="images/5868413.png" alt=""> Drawing</h2>

        <p class="foodz"> Drawing is so time consuming and fun that I could do it for hours a day. My favorite types are sketching and digital art. Sketching took a lot of time and practice and over the course of a few months I turned how to be a natural at it. After I started I couldn't stop and even took classes in middle school (Kealing.)</p>
        <h2 class="rollss"><img width="30px" src="images/5868413.png" alt=""> Swimming</h2>
  
        <p class="foodz">Swimming is also very fun and I like to do it whenever I can. One point in Summer I went to the pool almost every single day with my friend and we had tons of fun. My favorite types of swimming are breath stroke, free style, and my most favorite butterfly because it felt like you are soaring through the air.</p> 
        <h2 class="rollss"><img width="30px" src="images/5868413.png" alt=""> Video Games</h2>
  
        <p class="foodz">Video games were very popular around my age and most of the kids played Minecraft and Fortnite. Those two are my ideal day to day games to play. I played Fortnite a lot more and whenever my friends were playing I joined them in a game of Minecraft Bedwars (I kinda dominated.)</p>
